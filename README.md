# Real galaxy catalog from COSMOS-Web for GalSim and SLSim

This repository contains code to produce a real galaxy catalog for use with GalSim and SLSim from the COSMOS-Web survey. It is the COSMOS-Web version of [this dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/3242143) which uses data from the HST COSMOS survey.

This work is based [in part] on observations made with the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope. The data were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-03127 for JWST. These observations are associated with program #1727.
